My name is Dave Cunningham, and I was born on May 28th, 1982 in Ossining, New 
York. I grew up in Connecticut, attended Marist College, completed a masters
at Drexel University, and am currently a graduate student at Tulane.
My son Matthew was born on January 31st, 2016 and I love him so much.
I also love my wife, Kathleen.
I think I may like science today. That depends on whether or not the 
contamination issue.
